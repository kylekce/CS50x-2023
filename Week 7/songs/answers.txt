To characterize a person's audio aura, I could calculate the average value of the top 100 songs' danceability, energy,
key, loudness, speechiness, valence, tempo, and duration. However, this method might not be very representative of the
listener so I propose adding additional variables such as the listeners' mood, activity, and other outside factors. And
use an algorithm or machine learning to identify their patterns such as their music of choice during a workout, study,
and other activities.
