Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Top countries like Switzerland, France, and Argentina from 10 simulations would go lower as the number of simulations increased.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After 100,000 simulations, the results of top countries would become similar.
